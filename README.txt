[h1]Pony-Stuff-Re-Reuploaded - Reborn[/h1]

(This is the most evil naming convention I have ever seen...)

The development version of this MOD will be updated in real-time on [url=https://github.com/Lyther/Pony-Stuff-Re-Reuploaded---Reborn]GitHub[/url]. If you want to play the latest development version instead of the stable version, you can get the latest commit by using 'git pull' on the GitHub repository.

The beloved Pony MOD has been updated to version 3.8.3, and new content has been added, including empire scale, leaders, cabinets, and more. Two new pony naming tables have also been added, and all content supports both Chinese and English.

[h2]Civics[/h2]

Different types of civics have been added based on the content of the My Little Pony G4 series. Each civic corresponds to different buffs and characteristics, including providing new starbase modules to obtain empire corrections. Similarly, the characteristics of the civic can also be further strengthened by stacking starbase buildings.

Starports, star forts, star castles, and skyhold can build different starbase modules. The corresponding starbase module will be automatically upgraded when the starbase is upgraded through an automatic upgrade order.

Each different civic also provides corresponding council positions to unlock councilor officials based on the characteristics of the civic.

[h2]Species[/h2]

Multiple species types have been added, including various ponies and other races appearing in the G4 series. These races will also be randomly generated in AI-preset countries. Each different species has three corresponding types: organic, rocky, and mechanical, making it easier for players to choose.

The images of the species are also being updated.

[h2]Naming Lists[/h2]

Two new pony naming lists have been added, naming ships, fleets, leaders, planets, and armies after the names of episodes, characters, locations, and more that appeared in the G4 series, increasing immersion.
